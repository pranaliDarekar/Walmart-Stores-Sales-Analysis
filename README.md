# Walmart-Stores-Sales-Analysis
In our exploration of the dataset, we crafted a series of questions aimed at uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations within the data. These questions guided our SQL-based exploratory data analysis and set the stage for deeper investigations. The list of questions we addressed includes:

1. **Are there missing values in the dataset?**
   - We initiated our analysis by checking for null or missing values across all columns to ensure the integrity of our dataset and determine if any data preprocessing was necessary.

2. **What are the summary statistics of the dataset?**
   - We sought to understand the basic statistical properties of the dataset, including the distribution of weekly sales, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates.

3. **What is the impact of temperature on sales?**
   - By categorizing temperatures into different ranges (e.g., Below Freezing, Cold, Mild, Warm, Hot), we analyzed how sales averages varied across these categories to gauge the temperature's influence on consumer behavior.

4. **How do sales vary by month and quarter?**
   - Identifying the best and worst months and quarters for sales helped us understand seasonal trends and the periods of highest and lowest consumer activity.

5. **Which stores have shown the highest annual and quarterly sales growth?**
   - We calculated the sales growth for each store on an annual and quarterly basis to highlight which locations were outperforming others in terms of sales increases, providing insights into regional performance and growth trends.

6. **What are the effects of CPI and fuel prices on sales?**
   - Similar to the temperature analysis, we proposed examining the influence of economic indicators like CPI and fuel prices on sales by categorizing these variables into ranges and observing the average sales within each category.

7. **How can sales be predicted or forecasted based on the dataset?**
   - Beyond EDA, we considered the dataset's potential for predictive analytics, discussing the application of linear regression models and time series forecasting techniques to predict future sales based on historical data and external factors.

These questions served as a roadmap for our exploratory data analysis, helping to dissect the dataset from various angles and uncover valuable insights that could inform strategic decision-making and predictive modeling efforts.

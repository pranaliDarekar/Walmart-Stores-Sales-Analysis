# Walmart-Stores-Sales-Analysis
In the exploratory data analysis of the dataset, we posed several questions aimed at uncovering insights into sales performance, the impact of external factors, and identifying opportunities for forecasting. Here's a summary of the key questions asked:

What are the basic characteristics of the dataset?

This included checking for missing values in each column and obtaining summary statistics for numerical fields such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment rate, and weekly sales.
How do sales vary by time period?

What is the best and worst month for store sales?
What is the best and worst quarter for store sales?
These questions aimed to identify seasonal patterns and peak sales periods.
Which stores are performing the best and worst in terms of sales growth?

Which stores recorded the highest annual sales growth?
Which stores recorded the highest quarterly sales growth?
This analysis was designed to highlight top-performing stores and potentially investigate the reasons behind their success.
What is the impact of external factors on sales?

How does temperature affect weekly sales?
What is the impact of CPI and fuel prices on sales?
By examining the relationship between sales and factors like temperature, CPI, and fuel prices, we sought to understand how external conditions influence sales outcomes.
Each of these questions facilitated a deeper dive into the dataset, employing SQL queries to aggregate, summarize, and analyze data. The goal was to gain actionable insights, identify patterns, and lay the groundwork for predictive analytics. The exploration underscored the importance of understanding sales dynamics and the potential influence of external variables, setting the stage for more sophisticated analyses and forecasting efforts using advanced statistical methods or machine learning techniques.
